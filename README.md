The growing concern over high energy consumption and its environmental impact is a significant global issue. This project focuses on optimizing energy management in buildings by analyzing a comprehensive dataset collected from over 300 sensors over a three-year period. The dataset includes detailed information about the indoor environment, outdoor conditions, and HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems. This data is crucial for validating the model's predictions and ensuring their accuracy.

To achieve the project's goals, a combination of linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Gradient Boosting algorithms, is employed. The project involves utilizing pre-processed and cleaned data to train and evaluate these models, ultimately providing valuable insights that contribute to sustainable building practices.

The primary objective is not only to optimize energy usage within buildings but also to explore the relationship between energy consumption and environmental impact. By accurately predicting HVAC cooling and heating loads, the project aims to promote more sustainable building methods. The expected outcomes include reliable predictions of HVAC cooling and heating loads based on indoor and outdoor environmental data, with the broader goal of contributing to a healthier and greener future.
